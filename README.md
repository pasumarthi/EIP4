Convulution transforms the images into ,edges, gradients, patterns parts of object. by convolving over the image

Filters helps in extracting features from an iamges. 

Processing one set of all the images ina  dataset is called Epoch(includes forward & backward propogation) 

1*1 is not convulution layer. It is linear transformation. It is mergers similar channels.It helps  existing channels to create complex channels

3*3 is most commonly used filter. It is efficient as most of the hardware are optimized. And also being  odd value helps.


Featuremap is the output that come out of layer after cativation . The output of featuresmap is a channel

Activation function provde non-linearity as everything cannot be expressed by linear functions

Receptive field can be said how much particular neuran in alayer  can see the part of image from previous layer.
